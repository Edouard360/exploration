# Exploitation

This folder is a messy container for the **first approaches from the beginning of the project**.

It includes:

- Our own implementation *`kernel_alignment.py`* inspired from the paper:

    - Detection and Characterization of Anomalies in Multivariate Time Series, by H Cheng 2009 - â€ŽCited by 58
    
- A top discord algorithm with heuristics to optimize the computation. In *`unusual_subsequence.py`* and *`heuristic.py`*.*`heuristic.py`* makes use of the Trie class in the `trie.py` file.

- A *`potential.py`* file for analysing variance and autocorrelation in time series as harbingers for sudden regime changes.
